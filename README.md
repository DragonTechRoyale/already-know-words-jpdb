# already-know-words-jpdb
A very short script to move all the words in a jpdb.io deck to the already known deck. Not guaranteed to work (is set to work on a specific deck, so changes are needed to be make). Make sure you have selenium (with geckdriver in the running directory) and py_console installed

usage:

```
cd already-know-words-jpdb 
python3 jpdb.py
```
