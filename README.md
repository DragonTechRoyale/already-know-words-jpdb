# already-know-words-jpdb
A very short script to move all the words in a jpdb.io deck to the already known deck. Not guaranteed to work (is set to work on a specific deck, so changes are needed to be made). Make sure you have selenium (with geckdriver in the running directory) and py_console installed.

I made it to have all the words in one deck as known because I've watched the anime of the deck and it was simpler writing this script than moving each word seperetely 

usage:

```
cd already-know-words-jpdb 
python3 jpdb.py
```
